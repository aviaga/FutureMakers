# SureStart MIT FutureMakers

SureStart MIT FutureMakers is a 6 week program centered on the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The program is created and developed by [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and the [MIT RAISE Initiative](https://raise.mit.edu/).

The 2021 program began on July 6, 2021, and included the following:
* Learning AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning concepts
* Building AI models through hands-on tutorials, with 1-on-1 support from a mentor
* Hearing from career experts in the tech industry
* Developing entrepreneurship and leadership skills through seminars and activities
* Creating a new, AI-based product that addresses a real-world problem


To see some of my work, please take a look at the [code](https://github.com/aviaga/FutureMakers) section of this Repo. Also, be sure to check out the AI product my team and I developed and worked on as part of the program's culminating event, the Create-a-thon! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=PpPyates9jI) is a link to a recording of our pitch, and [here](https://github.com/Yabesra/DYADIC-Create-A-Thon) is the link to our Repo that has some more information about our project.
